# Bike-sharing-system
Hello everyone,  In this project I was trying to predict the number of users of bike-sharing system, I'm not sure I did it right, so I was hoping if someone with more knowledge than me would give it look and tell me how can I improve this. Overall, this is my first ML project (I'm currenltly covering Linear Regression model) so I hope for constructive feedback.
